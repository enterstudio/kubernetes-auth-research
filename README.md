# Kubernetes + Web UI Combined Auth

Auth methods available (per the Kubernetes docs):

> Kubernetes uses client certificates, bearer tokens, an authenticating proxy, or HTTP basic auth to authenticate API requests through authentication plugins

* Client certificates: Easy provisioning within the API server, as any certificate issued by the CA is considered valid. How to revoke? Can't be used directly in a browser context, but CA generation could be something that is done in the Web UI or via the CLI.
* Bearer tokens: Static, easy to revoke, easy to use in plaintext (`--token <token>`). Otherwise arbitrary, and not easy to save to a file as with certs. Arguably less secure than certs? Also not usable directly by a browser, as sending the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header isn't doable out of the box. Requires API Server restart whenever a token is added or removed, which is probably a deal-breaker
* Auth proxy: An OpenID connect service. This has the most open-ended potential, as we could create an OpenID connect endpoint with arbitrary back-end behaviors but a k8s-compatible interface
* Basic auth: Compatible with web browsers, but not necessarily with external auth sources. Require API Server restart whenever credentials are added or removed, which is probably a deal-breaker


## Client certificates

Using a web UI, provision certificates for authenticated users, signing them with a single, trusted CA. The CA is created when the cluster is provisioned and passed to the Kubernetes API server using the `--client-ca-file` flag

### Provisioning access

1. A user logs in to the web UI using the customer's chosen auth method (typically SSO of some sort).
1. Within the web UI, the user requests access to a cluster
  1. The web UI creates a random, unique ID _{id}_ for the new certificate pair.
  1. The web UI creates a strong private key
  1. The web UI creates a CSR using _{id}_ as the common name, and the user's username and/or group memberships in the organization fields. e.g:

    ```
    openssl req -subj "/CN={id}/O=user:johndoe/O=group1/O=group2"
    ```

  1. The web UI creates and signs a certificate and sends the certificate and private key to the user
  1. The web UI stores _{id}_ in a list as an indicator that it is a valid certificate
1. The user sees the newly-created certificate added to the list of certificates they've provisioned and can download the certificate and private key

### Using access

1. A user configures the `kubectl` client to use their client certificate, either through static config or command-line flags.
1. kube-apiserver verifies that the user's certificate was issued by the predetermined CA, then parses the common name and group information for use by the webhook authorization service.
1. kube-apiserver sends a webhook to the authorization service, including identifying information extracted from the client certificate, including _{id}_.
1. The authorization service:
  1. verifies that the certificate with the ID _{id}_ has not been revoked.
  1. verifies that the user (identified by the group `user:{username}`) has access to the requested resource
  1. Responds with an appropriate `SubjectAccessReview` response (allowed: true/false)

### Revoking access

**Note:** Kubernetes does not support certificate revocation lists, so any certificate issued by the CA will be valid for as long as the CAâ€™s private key remains the same (probably forever). Thus, we cannot prevent _authentication_ from revoked certificates, but we can prevent _authorization_.

1. To revoke a certificate, a user or admin would "delete" it using the web UI.
1. The Web UI would mark the certificate with ID _{id}_ as having been revoked
1. On future authorization requests, the authorization will see that the certificate with ID _{id}_ has been revoked and disallow access.
